# 19-Blockchain-Wallet-HW
This repo contains homework for unit 19 of my fintech course.

## Intention
You work at a startup that is building a new and disruptive platform called Fintech Finder. Fintech Finder is an application that its customers can use to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them. As Fintech Finderâ€™s lead developer, you have been tasked with integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable your customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency.

## Description
This homework task required me to make use of streamlit, python, ganache and a python library, web3, which I have recently been introduced too. The resulting output connects to an applictaion called Ganache through the streamlit interface. Ganache is commonly used for testing and experimenting on the Ethereum network, as it creates a mock environment of the popular blockchain. Through the interface you have the ability to select a Fintech professional and make payment for a selected amount of hours you would like to pay them to work.
